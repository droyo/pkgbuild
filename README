These PKGBUILD scripts will build Arch Linux packages
of unix utilities that I find exceedingly useful. To
build any package, you have the Arch Build System
installed:

	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Build_System

A package may be built like so:
	$ cd _package-name_
	$ makepkg

All packages require the musl libc:
	http://musl-libc.org/

There are several musl packages an the Arch User Repository
for you to install, such as 
	https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/musl

If you run into any problems running the software in these
package, before taking it up with the author, ensure that
you see the same issue when using software built according
to the authors' instructions on the respective web sites.
I am happy to correct any errors in my packaging and don't
want the authors being bugged over my mistakes.
